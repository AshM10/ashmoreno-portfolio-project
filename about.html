              I worked in the Hospitality Industry for 9 years, and now
              transitioning to tech. I’ve done this because I’ve always been
              fascinated by web development being surrounded by computer games
              growing up. I know I possess the necessary skills and experience
              you are seeking and would make a valuable addition to your
              company.
              <br />
              <br />
              I have built my career around leadership, problem-solving,
              communication, and team mentality by managing and training team
              members. Although I am a budding front-end developer, I’ve taken
              numerous training and certification programs to assist my
              professional development that can contribute to the success of my
              employer itself: these certifications include Responsive Web
              Development, React Development, AWS Cloud Practitioner, and SEO.
              <br />
              <br />
              I am a lifelong learner, and I can be a valuable addition to your
              team based on my determination, constant self-improvement and
              knowledge of aesthetics. My passion for drawing and painting will
              also come in handy as a front-end developer, knowing that tech is
              a user-centric industry, my creativity would be advantageous. I
              currently volunteer for a startup as a Graphic Designer, creating
              media content for their social media.
              <br />
              <br />
              I recently joined the Girl Develop It Hack for Health Hackathon,
              and our team won third place. Team members are mostly front-end
              developers, leading us to take on different roles and learn new
              technologies. My skills in front-end development help me handle a
              variety of challenges such as designing a website that is pleasing
              to the eyes and mobile responsive. My experience with projects has
              helped me to hone my development skills and gain practical
              knowledge. I’m looking for a long-term position where I can
              demonstrate my skills and continue to grow and support the team.
