            <h2 class="mb-4">Frontend Developer, based in Austin, Texas.</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
              As a kid, I have always been fascinated with computer games. All
              the cool characters, solving each challenge, gaining access to the
              next levels, finishing the entire game on hard mode, competing
              with other players, and just admiring how beautiful a game was
              built; I became addicted to computer games and I wanted to play my
              whole life.
              <br />
              It was hard for me coming from a poor family, I do not have access
              to all the games that I love. I remember saving up my lunch money
              so I can go to computer rentals, top-up my character, and play
              hard to become one of the strongest players in the game. I would
              also hang out with friends and cousins who had the newest
              consoles, play computer games with them, and beat them.
              <br />
              I knew then that I would want to be a game developer! Combining my
              love for art, making characters for a game, and programming a
              different game that would challenge me each time.
              <br />
              My dream was cut short when I wasn’t accepted in by my college to
              pursue Computer Science. It was hard to be self-taught back then.
              I had to go on with my life and continue studying for a different
              career. The path I took, taught me a lot of things about customer
              service. I used to be a loner, but I became sociable, and I gained
              a lot of friends. Suddenly it wasn’t just the computer I get along
              with! This path made me the person I am today, and I wouldn’t
              change anything about it.
              <br />
              Fast forward to now, I am able to finish coding workshops through
              SheCodes! I learned a lot about Front-end and React Development
              through their online workshops. I know this is just the beginning.
              I will continue learning, so I can become a Fullstack Developer,
              and eventually a Game Developer!
